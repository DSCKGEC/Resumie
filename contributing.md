This is the contributing.md of our project. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. 
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. 
Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

## Guidelines
- Before starting to work on any issue or feature, open an issue explaining the changes you want to make and wait for any of the project maintainers to assign it to you.
- Once the issue has been assigned, we'd recommend you creating a new branch with name `issue-xx` where xx is the issue number that you were assigned to.
- Before commiting any changes, make sure you format the code. (You can use formatters like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/))
- Use better commit messages that explain the changes you make. View the example below:

    - Bad commit message: `updated readme`
    - Good commit message: `updated contributors list in readme`
- You **should not**, in any case, use resources or code snippets from sources that do not allow their public use.
