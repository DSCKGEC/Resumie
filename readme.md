## Description

Having your CV and portfolio with you wherever you go is incredible! Resumie will keep your personal details and create your professional resume of any kind just in a few minutes.

### What's the problem?
Most of us often forget to carry our CV and portfolio along with us. It becomes really useful if we have an app that can generate our resume within few minutes and we don't miss any opportunity coming in our way!

### How can this project help?
Resumie will help its users never miss an opportunity. An app specially designed to create your CV and store your projects as well.

### The idea
The app is based on the idea of using simple fragments with layouts and rendering the input data by users to a PDF Document created in a different activity.

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Takes input from User

See below for our future steps.

- Saving the state of the fragments
- Transferring data of fragments to activity all at once 
- Creating a design for the resume
